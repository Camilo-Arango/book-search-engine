## Deployed Application 

The application could not be deployed due to dependency issues with the package installations that could not be resolved.

## Usage

This application would allow to search for books, save books to your saved book list and remove books from the saved book list.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you should be able to run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It would correctly bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you could `eject` at any time. This command should remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it would copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` should still work, but they would point to the copied scripts so you could tweak them. 

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
